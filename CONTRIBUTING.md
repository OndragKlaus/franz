## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Franz Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [stefan@adlk.io](mailto:stefan@adlk.io).

## What should I know before I get started?
With Franz 5, we have completely separated the client and the services. If you have any issues with a service recipe, please do not open an issue at this repository. Instead head over to the [Franz Recipe Repository](https://github.com/meetfranz/plugins) and open a new issue there.

If you need help with development, want to discuss a new feature or improvement please talk to us either on [Slack](https://slack.franz.im) or open a new issue with the [feature proposal template](.github/FEATURE_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md).

## How Can I Contribute?
As a basic rule, before filing issues, feature requests or anything else. Take a look at the issues and check if this has not already been reported by another user. If so, engage in the already existing discussion.
